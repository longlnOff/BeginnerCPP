// Exercise 4-8. Create a program that prompts the user to enter an amount of money between
// $0 and $10 (decimal places allowed). Any other value is to be rejected politely. Determine
// how many quarters (25c), dimes (10c), nickels (5c), and pennies (1c) are needed to make up
// that amount. For our non-American readers, one dollar ($) equals 100 cents (c). Output this
// information to the screen and ensure that the output makes grammatical sense (for example, if
// you need only one dime, then the output should be “1 dime” and not “1 dimes”).
