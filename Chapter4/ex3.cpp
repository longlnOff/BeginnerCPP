// Exercise 4-3. Create a program that prompts for input of a number (nonintegral numbers are
// allowed) between 1 and 100. Use a nested if, first to verify that the number is within this
// range and then, if it is, to determine whether it is greater than, less than, or equal to 50. The
// program should output information about what was found.
