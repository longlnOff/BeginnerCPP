// Exercise 4-2. Write another program that prompts for two integers to be entered. This time,
// any negative number or zero is to be rejected. Next, check whether one of the (strictly positive)
// numbers is an exact multiple of the other. For example, 63 is a multiple of 1, 3, 7, 9, 21, or 63.
// Note that the user should be allowed to enter the numbers in any order. That is, it does not
// matter whether the user enters the largest number first or the smaller one; both should work
// correctly!
