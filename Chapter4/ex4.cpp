// Exercise 4-4. It’s time to make good on a promise. Somewhere in this chapter we said we’d
// look for someone “who is older than 21, younger than 35, is female, has a bachelor’s or
// master’s degree, is unmarried, and speaks Hindi or Urdu.” Write a program that prompts the
// user for these qualifications and then outputs whether they qualify for these very specific
// requirements. To this end, you should define an integer variable age, a character variable
// gender (to hold 'm' for male, 'f' for female, etc.), a variable degree of an enumeration type
// AcademicDegree (possible values: none, associate, bachelor, professional, master,
// doctor), and three Boolean variables: married, speaksHindi, and speaksUrdu. Emulate a
// trivial online job interview and query your applicant for input on all these variables. People who
// enter invalid values do not qualify, of course, and should be ruled out as early as possible (that
// is, immediately after entering any invalid value; ruling them out precognitively prior to entering
// invalid values, sadly, is not possible yet in Standard C++).
