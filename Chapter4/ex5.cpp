// Exercise 4-5. Add some code to the end of the main() function of Ex4_07.cpp to print an
// additional message. If you have exactly one mouse, output a message of the form “It is a
// brown/white mouse.” Otherwise, if you have multiple mice, compose a grammatically correct
// message of the form “Of these mice, N is a/are brown mouse/mice.” If you have no mice, no
// new message needs to be printed. Use an appropriate mixture of conditional operators and
// if/else statements.
