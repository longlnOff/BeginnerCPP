// Exercise 5-7. Write a program that will read and store an arbitrary sequence of records
// relating to products. Each record includes three items of dataâ€”an integer product number,
// a quantity, and a unit price. For product number 1001, the quantity is 25 and the unit price is
// $9.95. Because you do not know yet how to create compound types, simply use three different
// array-like sequences to represent these records. The program should output each product
// on a separate line and include the total cost. The last line should output the total cost for all
// products. Columns should align, so the output should be something like this:
// ProductQuantityUnit PriceCost
// 100125$9.95$248.75
// 100310$15.50$155.00
// $403.75
