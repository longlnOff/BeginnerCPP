// Exercise 5-5. Write a program equivalent to that of Exercise 5-4, except for the following:
// •If before you used a for loop to count the characters, you now use while, or vice
// versa.
// •This time you should first reverse the characters in the array, before printing them
// out left to right (for the sake of the exercise you could still use a loop to print out
// the characters one by one).
