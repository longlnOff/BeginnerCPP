// Exercise 5-8. The famous Fibonacci series is a sequence of integers with the first two values as
// 1 and the subsequent values as the sum of the two preceding values. So, it begins 1, 1, 2, 3, 5,
// 8, 13, and so on. This is not just a mathematical curiosity. The sequence also regularly appears
// in biological settings, for instance. It relates to the way shells grow in a spiral, and the number
// of petals on many flowers is a number from this sequence. Create an array<> container with
// 93 elements. Store the first 93 numbers in the Fibonacci series in the array and then output
// them one per line. Any idea why weâ€™d be asking you to generate 93 Fibonacci numbers and
// not, say, 100?
