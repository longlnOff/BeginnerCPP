// Exercise 6-3. Write a program that reads an array size from the keyboard and dynamically
// allocates an array of that size to hold floating-point values. Using pointer notation, initialize all
// the elements of the array so that the value of the element at index position n is 1 / (n + 1)2.
// Calculate the sum of the elements using array notation, multiply the sum by 6, and output the
// square root of that result.
