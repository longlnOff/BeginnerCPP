// Exercise 3-6. Weâ€™ll conclude with one more exercise for puzzle fans (and exclusively so).
// Write a program that prompts for two integer values to be entered and store them in integer
// variables, a and b, say. Swap the values of a and b without using a third variable. Output the
// values of a and b.
// Hint: This is a particularly tough nut to crack. To solve this puzzle, you exclusively need one
// single compound assignment operator.
