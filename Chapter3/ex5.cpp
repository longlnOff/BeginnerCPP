// Exercise 3-5. Write a program that defines an enumeration of type Color where the enumerators
// are red, green, yellow, purple, blue, black, and white. Define the type for enumerators as
// an unsigned integer type and arrange for the integer value of each enumerator to be the RGB
// combination of the color it represents (you can easily find the hexadecimal RGB encoding of any
// color online). Create variables of type Color initialized with enumerators for yellow, purple, and
// green. Access the enumerator value and extract and output the RGB components as separate values.
