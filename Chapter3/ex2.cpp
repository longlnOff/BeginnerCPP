// Exercise 3-2. Write a program to calculate how many square boxes can be contained in a
// single layer on a rectangular shelf, with no overhang. The dimensions of the shelf in feet and
// the dimensions of a side of the box in inches are read from the keyboard. Use variables of type
// double for the length and depth of the shelf and type int for the length of the side of a box.
// Define and initialize an integer constant to convert from feet to inches (1 foot equals 12 inches).
// Calculate the number of boxes that the shelf can hold in a single layer of type long and output
// the result.
