// Exercise 3-1. Create a program that prompts for input of an integer and store it as an int.
// Invert all the bits in this value and store the result as an int. Next, convert this inverted value
// to an unsigned int, and store it. Output the original value, the unsigned value with the bits
// inverted, and that same inverted value plus 1, each in binary representation and on one line. On
// the next line, output the original value, the signed inverted value, and the signed inverted value
// plus 1, each in decimal representation. These two lines should be formatted such that they look
// like a table, where the values in the same column are centered. You can add column headers
// as well if you like. All binary values should have leading zeros so they are all 32 bits long
// (assuming int values are 32 bits, which they usually are).
// Note: Flipping all bits and adding oneâ€”ring any bells? Can you perhaps already deduce what
// the decimal output will be before you run the program?
