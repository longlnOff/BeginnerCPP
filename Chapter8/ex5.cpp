// Exercise 8-5. Define a function that checks whether a given number is prime. Your primal check 
// does not have to be efficient; any algorithm you can think of will do. In case you have forgotten, 
// a prime number is a natural number strictly greater than 1 and with no positive divisors other 
// than 1 and itself. Write another function that generates a vector<> with all natural numbers 
// less or equal to a first number and starting from another. By default it should start from 1. 
// Create a third function that given a vector<> of numbers outputs another vector<> containing 
// all the prime numbers it found in its input. Use these three functions to create a program that 
// prints out all prime numbers less or equal to a number chosen by the user (print, for instance, 
// 15 primes per line). Note: In principle, you do not need any vectors to print these prime 
// numbers; obviously, these extra functions have been added for the sake of the exercise.
