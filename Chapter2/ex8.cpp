// Exercise 2-8. Here’s an extra exercise for puzzle fans. Write a program that will prompt the user
// to enter two different positive integers. Identify in the output the value of the larger integer and
// the value of the smaller integer. Using the decision-making facilities of Chapter 5, this would
// be like stealing a piece of cake from a baby while walking in the park. What makes this a tough
// brain teaser, though, is that this can be done solely with the operators you’ve learned about in
// this chapter!
