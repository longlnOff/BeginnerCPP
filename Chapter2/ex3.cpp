// Exercise 2-3. For your birthday youâ€™ve been given a long tape measure and an instrument that
// measures angles (the angle between the horizontal and a line to the top of a tree, for instance).
// If you know the distance, d, you are from a tree, and the height, h, of your eye when peering
// into your angle-measuring device, you can calculate the height of the tree with the formula
// h + d*tan(angle). Create a program to read h in inches, d in feet and inches, and angle in
// degrees from the keyboard, and output the height of the tree in feet.
