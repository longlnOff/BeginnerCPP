// Exercise 2-1. Create a program that converts inches to feet and inches. In case youâ€™re
// unfamiliar with imperial units: 1 foot equals 12 inches. An input of 77 inches, for instance,
// should thus produce an output of 6 feet and 5 inches. Prompt the user to enter an integer value
// corresponding to the number of inches and then make the conversion and output the result.
